# Youtube Mobile URL Shield AB+ - Simple reload mechanic and unmute bottom bar accessibility for autoplay.
**This is URL Shield AB+, a beta, data-lite, mobile front-end YouTube solution designed to prioritize speed and reliability over complex filtering.**

URL Shield offers a different path to achieving uninteruppted mobile youtube browsing. Instead of fighting YouTube's encryption, it monitors the video state in real-time and reloads the page without video player interruptions seamlessly. This will continue to work even when other third-party extensions aren't working for this purpose.

## ⚡️ How is this shield protection script different?

Normal shield scripts use "filter lists" to identify and remove interruptions. Some just black-out the video player and make the monetization invisible for 5 seconds or the duration of the monetization. Unfortunately, this is not very reliable. YouTube keeps changing how these elements "look," and the filters must be constantly updated. They are also very easy for YouTube to detect.

URL Shield AB+ takes a different approach. It monitors the video player's behavior directly. If an interruption starts, the script simply resets the page state. This method is virtually undetectable and cannot be stopped by standard anti-blocking scripts.

<br>

## 💎 How is this free?
URL Shield AB+ is 100% free for personal use. Unlike other extensions that offer "7-day trials" or subscriptions, this userscript is provided as an open-source tool for the community. There are no hidden fees, no "Pro" versions, and no tiers.

<br>

## 📱 Why do I have to tap to unmute?
This is a security feature of your mobile browser (Chrome/Safari), not a bug in the script. Mobile browsers block audio from playing automatically after a page reloads to prevent "loud" surprises. Since URL Shield reloads the page to skip the interruption, it triggers this protection.

To make this seamless, we provided a "Tap to Unmute" zone at the bottom of the screen. You may need to repeat this over several videos because of how fragile the video player works during YouTube monetization.
